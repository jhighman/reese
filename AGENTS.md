# AGENTS.md - Reese Learning Repo

This is a father-daughter learning space for coding and development.

## Purpose

Weekend mentoring sessions where Reese learns:
- **JavaScript** — as a grounding skill (via p5.js)
- **Git workflows** — beyond basics: issues, branches, PRs, code review

## Structure

```
reese/
├── GUIDE.md           ← teaching guide
├── README.md          ← project overview
├── examples/          ← p5.js code examples
├── kb/                ← knowledge base (git, js concepts)
└── sessions/          ← session notes
```

## Working with This Repo

### For Teaching
- Use `examples/` for hands-on coding
- Reference `kb/` for concept explanations
- Log sessions in `sessions/`

### For Learning Git
- Create issues for tasks
- Work on branches
- Submit PRs for review
- Practice the full workflow

## Agent Guidance

When helping with this repo:
- **Be patient** — this is a learning environment
- **Explain the "why"** — understanding > memorization
- **Encourage experimentation** — mistakes are learning
- **Keep it fun** — creativity matters as much as correctness

## What's Off-Limits

- Don't do the work for her — guide, don't solve
- Don't skip explanations — understanding is the goal
- Don't make it feel like school — this is exploration
