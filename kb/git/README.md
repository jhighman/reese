# Git & GitHub

Learning version control the way professionals use it — not just commit/push, but the full collaboration workflow.

## Topics

1. **[basics.md](basics.md)** — Clone, commit, push, pull
2. **[branching.md](branching.md)** — Working on feature branches
3. **[issues.md](issues.md)** — Using GitHub Issues as a backlog
4. **[pull-requests.md](pull-requests.md)** — The PR review workflow
5. **[workflow.md](workflow.md)** — Putting it all together

## The Goal

By the end, you'll be able to:
- Pick up an issue from a backlog
- Create a branch for your work
- Make commits with good messages
- Open a pull request
- Respond to code review
- Merge your work

This is how teams actually build software.
