# Knowledge Base

Reference materials for our weekend mentoring sessions. These don't render on the site — they're here to learn from alongside the code.

## Sections

- **[git/](git/)** — Version control and GitHub workflows
- **[js/](js/)** — JavaScript fundamentals

## How to Use

1. Read the concept docs before or during our sessions
2. Try the examples in the main `examples/` folder
3. Ask questions — that's what we're here for!
