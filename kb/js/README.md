# JavaScript Fundamentals

The language underneath p5.js — and most of the web.

## Topics

1. **[variables.md](variables.md)** — Storing and naming values
2. **[functions.md](functions.md)** — Reusable blocks of code
3. **[conditionals.md](conditionals.md)** — Making decisions (if/else)
4. **[loops.md](loops.md)** — Repeating things
5. **[arrays.md](arrays.md)** — Lists of things
6. **[objects.md](objects.md)** — Grouping related data

## Why Learn This?

p5.js is JavaScript with training wheels for graphics. When you understand the JS underneath:

- You can do more complex things
- You can read other people's code
- You can use JS beyond p5.js (websites, servers, apps)

## The Connection

| p5.js concept | JS underneath |
|--------------|---------------|
| `let x = 100;` | Variable declaration |
| `function setup() {}` | Function definition |
| `if (mousePressed) {}` | Conditional |
| `for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++)` | Loop |

You're already writing JavaScript. Now we'll understand it more deeply.
